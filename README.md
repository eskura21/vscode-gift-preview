# VSCode GIFT Preview

NOTE: This plugin is currently in alpha.

This extension provides live preview of Moodle's GIFT format. It allows users to see GIFT questions in Moodle's default styling inside of VSCode.

This extension builds on the work of [fuhrmanator](https://github.com/fuhrmanator/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js) and is a fork of [tht13's html-preview-vscode](https://github.com/tht13/html-preview-vscode).

## Using the Extension

We recommend installing this extension from the [GIFT Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethan-ou.vscode-gift-pack). It will give you the core GIFT Language functionality as well as both error checking and preview.

After installing, open a GIFT file or switch VSCode into the GIFT language. Then, right click and select `Open Preview to the Side`.
